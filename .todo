Now:
  ☐ If no changed detected, ask nicely if we really want to bump the version or not
  ☐ Add support for running some command before committing (like compiling for instance)
  ☐ Add a `Bump: Init Changelog` command

Maybe:
  ☐ Use some heuristics to filter out some commits
    ☐ If there are too many commits maybe keep only those with the highest amount of changes
