Now:
  ☐ Add support for running some command before committing (like compiling for instance)
  ☐ Add a `Bump: Init changelog` command

Maybe:
  ☐ Add support for other kind of projects (non-NPM)
    ☐ Like what?
  ☐ Use some heuristics to filter out some commits
    ☐ If there are too many commits maybe keep only those with the highest amount of changes
